The table below summarizes all tagged animals that have been detected at this station during its operation. In an effort to remove false positives (where background radio static can resemble the signature of a tag) only tags whose signals were detected at least four consecutive times are included in this summary. Click on the link to view more details about each tag deployment on the Motus website, such as where it was tagged, the project that tagged it, as well as an overview of all the other stations that have detected this same tag.

<br>

```{r summarize good tags, fig.keep=T, fig.show=T, results=T}
datatable(goodruns_summary[, c(6, 8, 13)],
          colnames = c('Species' = 'speciesEN',
                       'Date Detected' = 'first_date',
                       'View on Motus.org' = 'map_link_href'),
          escape = F)
          
```

<br>

This map shows all the same animals as the table above, but displays all the additional stations where each of the tagged animals has been detected. Where the speed travelled between two stations seems plausible, a simplified movement path has been drawn to illustrate the distance and direction travelled. Click on a track line or point for a popup containing a link to that tag on the Motus website.
